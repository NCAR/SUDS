# SUDS
The *System for User-editing and Display of Soundings* (SUDS) is a package for
displaying and analyzing atmospheric sounding data. It was originally developed
it the Atmospheric Technology Division (now Earth Observing Laboratory) of the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research in the 1980's, and was developed and
used for some time after that. At this point, its value is mostly historical.

The original Subversion repository has been converted to Git, and now lives as an
archive at GitHub.

SUDS requires the [rdsslibs](https://github.com/NCAR/rdsslibs) package, also
available at GitHub.
