	FILE [NAME] filename [TYPE] format [ID] id-name

The FILE command makes the sounding in file 'filename' available for use.
The parameter 'format' is the type of file being accessed (class, nws, netcdf,
etc.), and 'id-name' is the name to be assigned to the sounding.  The current
default sounding will be re-assigned by this command.
