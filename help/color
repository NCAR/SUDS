	COLOR index-name color-name

	COLOR index-name RGB redval greenval blueval

The COLOR command is used to change the color associated with the specified 
'index-name' to some user selected value.  The allowed index names are:

	black	white	bg1	bg2	bg3	bg4
	data1	data2	data3	data4	data5	data6
	data7	data8	data9

These correspond to the current 'black' and 'white' values, the four colors 
used to draw backgrounds and annotations (bg1-bg4), and the nine colors used 
for drawing data traces (data1-data9).

A 'color-name' from the list of colors in the printed SUDS documentation is
then selected.  Normal colors like red, green, and blue are understood,
but there are many others defined ranging from aquamarine to wheat.

Optionally, the keyword RGB may be used, followed by 'redval', 'greenval', 
and 'blueval' to choose a custom color.  These values should be in the 
range 0.0-1.0.
