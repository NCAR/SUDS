	WSCALE val

The scaling of winds in skew-t and hodograph plots may be changed with the 
WSCALE command.  An approximation of the maximum wind speed in m/s should be 
used for 'val'.  Winds less than this speed are assured to appear within the 
bounds of the plot.  The wind scale value defaults to 25.0 m/s.
