Installation of SUDS
====================

RDSS Libraries
--------------

SUDS requires that the RDSS Libraries package has already been
installed.  It is available at:

	ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/rdpdist

Look for a file named rdsslibs-<version>.tar.gz.

SUDS Installation
-----------------
First, unpack the archive and go to the directory which is
created:

	$ tar xvzf suds-<version>.tar.gz
	$ cd suds-<version>
	
To install under /usr/local, and assuming RDSS libraries are also installed 
under /usr/local:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

The following flags for "configure" can be used for other installation
options:

	--prefix=<dir>	change the installation location for SUDS.  The 
			default is "/usr/local".

	--with-rdss=<dir>	tell where the RDSS utilities can be found.  
			By default, the installation directory for SUDS
			is assumed.
