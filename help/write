	WRITE [FILE] fname [[FROM] id-name]
		--or--
	NETCDF [FILE] fname [[FROM] id-name]

The WRITE and NETCDF commands will cause sounding 'id-name' to be written 
to the disk as file 'fname'.  If the sounding is not specified, the current
default sounding will be written.  When the WRITE command is used, soundings
will be written using the  CLASS format.  The 'old' or 'new' CLASS format may
be selected by the oldCLASS flag (default=false).  The NETCDF command causes a 
netCDF file to be written.
