	FILE [NAME] filename [TYPE] format [ID] id-name
		OR
	FILE [NAME] filename [TYPE] WMO [ONLY sitename] [ID] id-name

The FILE command makes the sounding in file 'filename' available for use.
The parameter 'format' is the type of file being accessed (class, nws, netcdf,
etc.), and 'id-name' is the name to be assigned to the sounding.  The current
default sounding will be re-assigned by this command.

For WMO sounding files, a specific sounding site may optionally 
be selected if "ONLY sitename" is added.
