	MARK

The MARK command causes the current cursor position to be marked as the 
beginning of the edit region.  As the cursor is moved from this point, the
edit region will be highlighted by being displayed in white.  The MARK
stays in effect until either:  1) The edit region is CUT,  2) a new edit
field is SELECTed, or 3) A new MARK is set.
