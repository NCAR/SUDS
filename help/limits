	LIMITS fld bottom top

	CONLIMITS fld center step

	ILIMITS fld bottom top step gap

The LIMITS command allows the user to set the bounds for plotting a field.
The 'bottom' and 'top' values will be the bottom (or left) and top (or right)
bounds for the field in x-y plots, and for the pressure and altitude fields
in skew-t and cross-section plots.

The CONLIMITS command allows the user to specify the contour plot limits for
field 'fld'.  The value 'center' should be a good middle value for the field
and 'step' is the spacing used between contours.  Note that the center value
only makes a difference for color displays, but it must always be specified.

The ILIMITS command allows the user to specify the bounds for
interpolating a sounding.  The 'bottom' and 'top' values will be the
bottom and top of the interpolated data.  The 'step' will be the output
step size of the data, and 'gap' is the gap size.  If a gap is detected
in the input data, no interpolation will occur across the gap.
