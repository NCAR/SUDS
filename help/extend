	EXTEND

The EXTEND command causes the currently selected field to be altered such
that the value of the field at the cursor will be extended to the surface.
The extension follows a dry adiabat if temperature is currently selected or
holds a constant mixing ratio if dewpoint is selected.  Other fields cannot
be EXTENDed.
