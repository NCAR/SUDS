	HODOGRAPH [STEP sval] [MARK mval] [TOP topval] [s1 s2...sn]

The HODOGRAPH command will plot hodographs for one or more soundings 
specified by 's1'...'sn'.  If no sounding is specified, the current default
sounding will be used.  

If STEP is specified, a wind point will be drawn every 'sval' km 
rather than for every point in the sounding.  

When MARK is used, an altitude label will be placed on the plot at each 
increment of 'mval' km MSL.  By default, the labels are drawn every 1 km.

If TOP is specified, the hodograph will only be plotted up to 'topval'
km MSL.  By default, soundings are plotted up to 20 km.
