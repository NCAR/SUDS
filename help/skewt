The normal SKEWT command will plot up to three soundings ('s1', 's2', 's3') 
together on a single skew-t, log p plot.  If no sounding is specified, the
current default sounding will be plotted.  

The default pressure and temperature limits of skew-t, log p plots can be 
changed with the SKEWT PLIMITS and SKEWT TLIMITS commands, respectively.
For pressure, 'pmax' and 'pmin' specify the maximum and minimum pressures 
in millibars to be plotted.  For temperature, 'tmin' and 'tmax' are the 
temperature limits in deg. C for the bottom of the plot (which corresponds
to pmax).  
 
The command "SKEWT PLIMITS pmax pmin" has exactly the same effect as 
"LIMITS PRES pmax pmin".  This equivalence does NOT exist for the temperature
field, though, because of temperature skewing.

The default wind barb resolution (10 m/s) can be changed with the SKEWT
BARBRES command.  This changes the definition of one wind barb to 'wres' m/s.
