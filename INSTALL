To install under /usr/local, if RDSS utilities are also installed under
/usr/local:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

The following flags for "configure" can be used for other installation
options:

	--prefix=<dir>	change the installation location for SUDS.  The 
			default is "/usr/local".

	--with-rdss=<dir>	tells where the RDSS utilities can be found.  
			The default is the installation directory for SUDS.
