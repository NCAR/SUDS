	XSECT fld
		or
	XSECT TIME-HEIGHT fld

The XSECT command draws a cross-section plot for field 'fld', given the current
settings of parameters specified below.  If the keyword TIME-HEIGHT appears, 
the plot will be a time-height plot of the chosen field.  If a
time-height plot is selected, wind barbs may be drawn at the times
corresponding to the soundings.  This is controlled by WINDS flag.

	XSECT USE snd1 snd2 snd3 [...sndN]

The XSECT USE command specifies the soundings to use for subsequent cross-
sections.  Two or more soundings must be specified.

	XSECT FROM SITE snd1 TO SITE snd2
		-or-
	XSECT FROM x0 y0 TO x1 y1

The endpoints 'snd1' and 'snd2' of a spatial cross-section are specified
with the XSECT FROM command.  The values are the names of soundings (not
site names) whose site locations will be used as the endpoints.  They need
not be soundings that are specified in the XSECT USE command.  Without
the SITE qualifier, (x,y) endpoints in km from the origin may be used.
Site and (x,y) endpoints may both be used if desired.

	XSECT CENTER x y [ANGLE] ang [LENGTH] len

The cross-section plane may alternately be specified using the XSECT CENTER
command.  The (x,y) center of the plane is given in km with respect to the
current origin, 'ang' chooses the angle (in degrees clockwise from north) of 
the plane, and 'len' specifies the length of the plane in km.

	XSECT VSCALE vfld

The vertical scale field is controlled with the XSECT VSCALE command.  The
parameter 'vfld' must be either "pres" or "alt", and specifies whether the
vertical is scaled by mb or km MSL.

	XSECT BARBRES value

The wind barb resolution is changed to 'value'.  It defaults to 10.0 m/s
and will be changed for wind barbs on either xsect or skewt plots by
this command.
