	INTERPOLATE field snd1 [snd2]

The INTERPOLATE command will use the sounding  snd2  to interpolate the 
data fields to a grid of field.  The result will be a new sounding with
the name  snd1. If no old sounding (snd2) is specified, the current default 
sounding will be used as the input data to the interpolation.

The new sounding which is created by the interpolation must be written 
with the WRITE command or it will be lost when suds exits.  It can be
used in plots and other commands prior to exiting suds.

The default limits for the independent field are shown with the SHOW
LIMITS command.  These can be changed with the ILIMITS command.  Only
three fields are allowed for independent fields during interpolation - 
temp, pres, and alt.

Care must be taken in selecting the limits of the interpolation.  Any
interpolation beyond the original data (extrapolation) may result in 
unrealistic data.  Some of these occurances are restricted by suds (i.e.
negative pressures), but data extrapolated beyond the original data is 
suspect.
