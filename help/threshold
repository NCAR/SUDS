	THRESHOLD [FIELD] fld [ON] tfld criterion [value] [[AND] tfld criterion [value] ...] [SOUNDING id-name]

The THRESHOLD command will remove points from target field 'fld' based on
the values of points in field(s) 'tfld' and the selected 'criterion'
relation(s).  If the sounding is not specified with the 'id-name'
parameter, the current default sounding will be used.  In the case of
multiple criteria, all must be met before the associated target point is
removed.  The list below shows what relations may be selected for the
criteria:

	    Criterion	Meaning
	----------------------------------------------------
		=	equal to 'value'
		<>	not equal to 'value'
		<	less than 'value'
		<=	less than or equal to 'value'
		> 	greater than 'value'
		>=	greater than or equal to 'value'
		BAD	bad data in 'tfld' (no 'value' is specified)
		INCREASING  increasing data in 'tfld' (no 'value' is
			specified)
		DECREASING  decreasing data in 'tfld' (no 'value' is
			specified)

As an example, the following command will remove all dewpoint values in the 
current default sounding for which the corresponding temperature is bad:

	threshold dp on temp bad

The next command would remove all wind speed values from the current default
sounding which were greater than 200 m/s:

	threshold wspd on wspd > 200.0

The next command would remove all temperature values from the current
default sounding for which the corresponding pressure is not decreasing:

	threshold temp on pres decreasing
